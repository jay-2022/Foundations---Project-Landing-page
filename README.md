# Foundations---Project-Landing-page

The task is to create an entire web page from a design provided by the Odin project team.

<img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png" width=50% height=50%>

In addition to this, another document was provided for some of the fonts and colors that were used in the design page. 

I have followed the design for the majority of the page, however I tweaked it slightly to get the desired outcome I had in my mind for the web page
